    <Strong><h1>Create A website Using HTML (Basic)</h1></Strong>
    <p>There are basically two ways to make a web page. The first way is to create the page(s) offline and then upload them to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) via FTP. The second way is to create your web page(s) online using a Telnet program by accessing your UNIX account, if you have one.

        <br><br><br>If you are creating your web page(s) offline, do so in any text editing or word processing document. Make sure that when you save your document, you save it as a "text", "plain text" or "text only" document. Otherwise it will not be read properly by a web browser. Once you have created your page(s), you will need to contact your ISP about how to go about uploading them to your server.
        
        <br><br><br><h1>cd public_html</h1>If you have a UNIX account, you can create your web page(s) online. You first need to get a program that can access your UNIX account. I recommend Telnet for the Mac or Ewan for Windows 95/98 
        "If you want to, you can make other directories, one for all the web pages that you make, and one for all of the graphics that you have. Follow the same steps as above to do this.

        <br><br><br>Next, you need to think of a filename for your page (this is not a title, but what will be in the URL). A common filename for a main web page, is "index". Once you've decided on this, add ".html" to the end of it. Then type (i.e.)
    <br><br><br><h1>pico index.html</h1>Of course, use your page's filename, instead of this one. Next, you need to gain some knowledge
    of the many HTML commands. Lucky for you, I've already gotten some of the basic commands
    for you. Follow the index below, to decide what to put on your page, and how to do it. Once
    you've gotten started, exit your page. You can do this by pressing control-x. Then you need to
    type:
     <h1>chmod 744 index.html</h1>
    Only do this with the file name of your page. You only need to do this very first time that you leave your web page. This command will make sure that nobody else can delete your page. You will need to do this to any other pages that you make in the future. Then look at your page on.</p>
